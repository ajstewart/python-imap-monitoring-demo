The CHILES version of the `Procmail' script that Tim Staley developed (see original README below).

The main loop in the monitor_imap script has commands specific to the agreed email format of CHILES data notifications from C. Hales pipeline.

It also includes a function to send confirmation emails that I have added.

---------------------------------

`Procmail for the Python+GMail generation';
a quick and dirty proof of concept.

Put this together in a couple of afternoons, 
got to know Imbox + Envelopes along the way. 


Now you too can conform to two of the laws of software development, 
with minimal effort!
